LSP (Linux Studio Plugins) is a collection of open-source plugins compatible with following plugin formats:

CLAP - set of plugins for Clever Audio Plugins API
JACK - Standalone versions for JACK Audio connection Kit with UI
LADSPA - set of plugins for Linux Audio Developer's Simple Plugin API
LV2 - set of plugins and UIs for Linux Audio Developer's Simple Plugin API (LADSPA) version 2
VST2 / LinuxVST - set of plugins for Steinberg's VST 2.4 plugin format
VST3 - set of plugins and for Steinberg's VST 3 plugin format
The basic idea is to fill the lack of good and useful plugins under the GNU/Linux platform.

After some contributions to other open source projects the decision was made to implement separate and independent plugin distribution.

Currently project is developed and maintained by LSP Project Team with the main founder and developer at the head â€“ Vladimir Sadovnikov.
